slide_slide2_0000-0010.wav|And let me quickly talk about my research. So here is my email address if you have any questions regarding to your courses,
slide_slide2_0010-0020.wav|To your future, you know, the other minor stuff, you can feel free to send me an email. My research and regular focus on, the
slide_slide2_0020-0030.wav|Directions. So first of all, I will majorly talk about my papers. I'll focus on transfer learning. So Especially, I focused on
slide_slide2_0030-0040.wav|Explain what is domain adaptation mean here. Next, I'm interested in manifold
slide_slide2_0040-0050.wav|Which is one kind of an explanation of space is different from our training space and and next, I'm interested in the shape analysis
slide_slide2_0050-0059.wav|This is really, relative related to medical field. And lastly, recently, I'm working for more focused on the audio denoising problem.
slide_slide3_0000-0010.wav|Let's see some examples. So first, right is above the domain adaptation. So in this slide, we will see our
slide_slide3_0010-0020.wav|And the test domain. And during our machine learning, we we have, like, the training dataset and test dataset. But in this case, we will refer.
slide_slide3_0020-0030.wav|Set that as a first domain and our test, that's set as a target domain. So now as you can see from see here, you cannot see significant difference.
slide_slide3_0030-0040.wav|Between your source domain and the target domain. So here, for example, those last three objects are from product domain, and here is just about
slide_slide3_0040-0050.wav|Outline of the clipart domain. So now you will observe the difference between those two domains if you apply this on existing machine learning models.
slide_slide3_0050-0060.wav|May not get a high accuracy, and those traditional machine models were will include the old domain all models that I'm will cover in the
slide_slide3_0060-0070.wav|Fourth semester, which means that for those traditional methods, either we will not get very high accuracy and similarly
slide_slide3_0070-0080.wav|We have another kind of datasets in the medical field. For example, we have the t one images and we have the flare images if we
slide_slide3_0080-0090.wav|Try to segment the t1 images focused on the parameter if we are then applying our model to the FLIR image, we will
slide_slide3_0090-0100.wav|A very good accurate result because you see the difference between your tumor images and the flare images are even worse, your system.
slide_slide3_0100-0110.wav|Can be only like images, but your target domain can be just some text. Now you you can direct the difference between
slide_slide3_0110-0120.wav|The images and the task. Right? And then this is the problem of the domain adaptation that we want to mitigate. The difference between our training and our test
slide_slide3_0120-0122.wav|test
slide_slide4_0000-0010.wav|And I will introduce one more of the previous that I developed out of those examples. That's exactly how manifold
slide_slide4_0010-0020.wav|Which means that if we are keeping sampling some samples from the source domain to the type domain, so now, you can see the this image in the
slide_slide4_0020-0030.wav|Shoes, how monkey changes in the interviewer working human being. Right? So this corresponding to those plan
slide_slide4_0030-0038.wav|Dot here, so this is, about the time frame of the many goals.
slide_slide5_0000-0010.wav|And, also, this is about another application in the medical field that causes the shape analysis, which means that we want to check your
slide_slide5_0010-0020.wav|Shift the changes with the increasing of your age as you probably noticed that with the increasing of age you may more likely to get some diseases
slide_slide5_0020-0030.wav|Right? And, this is the meaning of this task. So for example, your input of all the network is just an agent. For exam
slide_slide5_0030-0040.wav|In this case, it's just a 16. And there's a out is the outer is just about, you know, 1, the shape of your brain structure.
slide_slide5_0040-0050.wav|So here, it's especially referred to the corpuscle sum, which is one of our brain structures that is related to your
slide_slide5_0050-0060.wav|And, specifically, we are reluctant to the outcome of diseases. If you found that your Cox group time is very small
slide_slide5_0060-0070.wav|You are more like to get the autumn automatic diseases. Right? So then get a prediction model. Now you can
slide_slide5_0070-0076.wav|To use both, preventing to preventing those kinds of diseases
slide_slide6_0000-0010.wav|And we also have applications that we, realize is, here is, animals, like, here, Just
slide_slide6_0010-0019.wav|The fly hard segmentation. The purpose here is try to segment the fly hard area, and then you can see how this area keep changes. Right?
slide_slide7_0000-0010.wav|And we also have other applications in the cow teed segmentation and the classification. So, again, I just use some results about the area.
slide_slide7_0010-0020.wav|Those kept in the bounding box to refer to the location, and this is giving color scheme to, to the area. And this is different number means
slide_slide7_0020-0030.wav|Different causes of the diseases. If it is one, it means normal. If it is two, it means it's abnormal. So sometimes you
slide_slide7_0030-0040.wav|We are seeing here, there are two deeds because of the truth is that most of the cows are very healthy. Right?
slide_slide7_0040-0046.wav|Just a few of them can get diseases, but then later, you will see some of a lot of them.
slide_slide8_0000-0010.wav|And, basically, we have another lecture about audio denoising. You probably have noticed that audio denoising is more likely in this another
slide_slide8_0010-0020.wav|Field does not, for example, in the internal process, However, we are converting the audio signals into audio images. There's also
slide_slide8_0020-0030.wav|After that, we can do some kind of process of the audios, but eventually upload and get some segmentation model. We can try to
slide_slide8_0030-0039.wav|I can segment the audio images after we apply the inverse of short time Fourier transformation. We get the denoised audio.
slide_slide9_0000-0010.wav|And now we can quickly listen. For example, in this case, can you hear anything? But if you look at the signal here in the
slide_slide9_0010-0020.wav|Left hand, you see a lot of, like, noise. You just, you know, bring it over. But on your right hand, once you get the denoised,
slide_slide9_0020-0029.wav|Can see a clear patterns of this sound. Right? This is, called a realization of the purpose of.
slide_slide10_0000-0010.wav|And then even further, we have other applications related to audio sim separation, so you can also pay attention to those two figures as you can see.
slide_slide10_0010-0020.wav|Here. Right? And the same on the left hand, the this figure is about noisy mixing birds. By the right hand, there are 2 different colors. So
slide_slide10_0020-0030.wav|The yellow color means the birdsong one, here, and the blue color means the birdsong two. So this is becomes
slide_slide10_0030-0033.wav|Becomes an image problem. Right?
slide_slide11_0000-0010.wav|Also, we have other applications set up about the audio enhancement as you can see in the left and also in the blue
slide_slide11_0010-0020.wav|Reference to the noisy bird sound, and this little bit of this red area refers to bird sound as you can see from here. The original audio
slide_slide11_0020-0030.wav|Very tiny, very small. Right? However, if you apply the audio's, enhancement, you can see it very big. It's very annoying
slide_slide11_0030-0040.wav|You cannot hear the audio in enhanced sounds. I'm trying to play it. This is, actually, the noise, a bird sound, very tiny.
slide_slide11_0040-0042.wav|And there's this one is a very pretty big.
slide_slide12_0000-0010.wav|Not always. For our online students, if you have any questions, basically, approach, to start meeting, I would like to hear.
slide_slide12_0010-0020.wav|A feedback from you guys. Okay? Don't be shy. Okay. Also, any questions? So now probably, we are starting with
slide_slide12_0020-0030.wav|Our mission learning cost. So that's the first time with the cost overview and, some things that is very important to all of you, specifically
slide_slide12_0030-0033.wav|Is our final scores. Right?
slide_slide13_0000-0010.wav|So here is a textbook. You guys might need to read. It is called, like, bible in machine learning field. In it is
slide_slide13_0010-0020.wav|Like, written by b sharp as a pattern recognition and machine learning. And here is an outline link. You can click it and download it.
slide_slide13_0020-0030.wav|That is, an online free PDF. It is not needed to buy the new one, but you can buy a new one if you want to read it the text.
slide_slide13_0030-0039.wav|And then this here is just our Canvas page, and then you can feel free to have some discussions online.
slide_slide14_0000-0010.wav|And, again, about our, pro prospect, I think of you should have noticed that. Right?
slide_slide14_0010-0020.wav|Actually, the last later case is May 10th, and our first time is Wednesday. This time, at this location
slide_slide14_0020-0030.wav|And, again, the Zoom link of the class for this is the only very good for our live students. But for others, I very encourage you.
slide_slide14_0030-0040.wav|You guys should not come in person unless you have some good reasons. Yes. A good reason. And don't say you are too tired. Okay?
slide_slide14_0040-0040.wav|Okay? 
slide_slide15_0000-0010.wav|And we also have office hours. It it is every Wednesday at four to five PM, and just come to my office.
slide_slide15_0010-0020.wav|Most of you, you are all of them come to the 64. It's about the 205, and I see
slide_slide15_0020-0030.wav|Of you guys, but not the, all of you. I did not speak in this matter, and then see you guys to come. Feel free to stop your
slide_slide15_0030-0034.wav|In the office after any kind of questions. Okay?
slide_slide16_0000-0010.wav|And then, again, the syllabus. How many of you check out our syllabus? None of you? Okay. That's fine. I will cover about
slide_slide16_0010-0011.wav|that part
slide_slide17_0000-0010.wav|So here I found some prerequisites. So basically just fundamental mathematics you already probably get from the 1st semester.
slide_slide17_0010-0020.wav|And also I will even next week, I will try to give you guys a quick review of some math that is required in this class And I think
slide_slide17_0020-0025.wav|We've got a Python by professor Pablo. It's good.
slide_slide18_0000-0010.wav|So here about assignments, some percentage that you have to know, it's like it's discussions,
slide_slide18_0010-0020.wav|Some participation is, like, ten percentage homework. And you guys, we have a kind of lots of homework, like
slide_slide18_0020-0030.wav|Each week, we will have some homework. It will not be that difficult. You need to devote some time on it. I'm sure you
slide_slide18_0030-0040.wav|I will get it. But finally, I will only select the highest selection of them for your final grade. And lastly, it's about the final project.
slide_slide18_0040-0050.wav|It's about thirty percentage for that reason, your final project is like your first semester first year come to my office, talk to me to
slide_slide18_0050-0060.wav|Your favorite project. You want to welcome, and so then you need to write a quick proposal for that. At the last day
slide_slide18_0060-0070.wav|You need to present your final project, then do and maybe answer questions for your audience. I will not have any exam
slide_slide18_0070-0080.wav|But if you guys like exams, tell me. I will make that an exam for you. Okay. I I I really hope some students tell.
slide_slide18_0080-0090.wav|Me, you guys want some exam, and I can remove this grading system percentage lower. If you guys can, tell me some
slide_slide18_0090-0100.wav|Exams or final exams. Are you ready? Complete? No? No? Nobody likes exams? Okay. So let's
slide_slide18_0100-0110.wav|How to adjust the key of this format? Professor, what about student? I have I have one question.
slide_slide18_0110-0120.wav|Team about team members. Is there any limits of the students the number of members in a group? Professor.
slide_slide18_0120-0130.wav|The team member, you mean? Student for the project or the final presentation? Professor, yes. Yeah. So
slide_slide18_0130-0140.wav|Yes. We, depending on your guys. If you guys sound like, other at the most, I would like to say two students per group.
slide_slide18_0140-0150.wav|Because, totally, we have around twelve students. Right? So at the most, like, two person in one group, but you can do it by yourself.
slide_slide18_0150-0160.wav|Think that, in that case, you will get some kind of actual points for that if you're doing you are doing it by yourself. Okay, student. Got it.
slide_slide18_0160-0165.wav|Thank you, professor. Any other questions? No? Okay. Great.
slide_slide19_0000-0010.wav|And I think any of you are from the first semester? No? It's from the second semester. You should know about this.
slide_slide19_0010-0013.wav|Different datum grades. Right?
slide_slide20_0000-0010.wav|And again, about the details of our class schedule, so we are in the first week. And then next week, we will talk about best
slide_slide20_0010-0020.wav|And data pre processing in the 3rd way, we are talking about the classification after that, we will talk about some regression and list
slide_slide20_0020-0030.wav|Squares and then we will talk about PCM, I think that some of you probably already talked about something about PCA. Right?
slide_slide20_0030-0040.wav|Okay. Those are the few guys. After, we are going to talk about the matrix factorization and the Gaussian mixture model. Basically, some neural network.
slide_slide20_0040-0050.wav|This entry is a vector, and we have two weeks for the holidays. Did you guys notice that? If not, that
slide_slide20_0050-0060.wav|I want to tell you, you will have two weeks at the holiday, as it will be a better time to start it. And after that, we
slide_slide20_0060-0070.wav|We have, like, neural network, Anselm method, and we are finished about the horse method, I'll have to emphasize that soon.
slide_slide20_0070-0080.wav|All like, all the contents in this machine learning course are very important to you because of your future, interviews.
slide_slide20_0080-0090.wav|They definitely will ask some question from this machine learning class. Remember that, and even if they ask you to implement some of those
slide_slide20_0090-0100.wav|Algorithms. So previously, like, one of the algorithms happened to be that is about decision tree. The interviewer will ask you
slide_slide20_0100-0110.wav|To implement or reimplement this decision tree from scratch. So so then during this this homework you
slide_slide20_0110-0120.wav|Guys have are ready to think about the first, like, you have an interview, you can implement those
slide_slide20_0120-0130.wav|By yourself. Okay. That's very important. Any questions so far? No? Student, one, do we have
slide_slide20_0130-0140.wav|The final project, professor. Yes. Let's go try to find it in our syllabus again. So here's all the content that I will cover.
slide_slide20_0140-0150.wav|In the whole semester As you can see here, we have the final project and some implementation of it In middle, you only
slide_slide20_0150-0160.wav|Like, thirteen different homeworks. Each of them, you will have, kind of small work student one soon.
slide_slide20_0160-0170.wav|Are all the projects independent for that or, like, a teamwork professor? You mean the homework student wanna know the project project?
slide_slide20_0170-0180.wav|Professor, the final project, as one student asked, it can be teamwork, but it depends on, it's no more than two
slide_slide20_0180-0190.wav|Persons, student two. And, for the next interview, professor, yeah, for the homework, just in the interviews.
slide_slide20_0190-0200.wav|Some very small small work. Like today, we will, I will ask you guys to answer. What's what is the machine?
slide_slide20_0200-0210.wav|Learning, and what is the future of it? Maybe next class, I will I want to give you guys a little bit easy stuff like that, And
slide_slide20_0210-0220.wav|For the other medium, I might need your guys to implement it from scratch. So you treat them carefully and like
slide_slide20_0220-0230.wav|In your interview, how you will implement the scale? These kinds of algorithms like Gaussian Mixture Model, how you will implement?
slide_slide20_0230-0240.wav|How you will will implement the decision tree. Right? So if you guys are ready, it's a good job in this class. I mean
slide_slide20_0240-0250.wav|Yeah. Future interview in future view ask the user same questions. We have no questions about that. You have
slide_slide20_0250-0260.wav|Immediately implemented, and you definitely have a good impression of them. So now the, might need some might hire you immediately, hopefully. Okay.
slide_slide20_0260-0261.wav|Okay.
slide_slide22_0000-0010.wav|Professor, so here, in the big picture of machine learning, just a particular way, we are start from artificial
slide_slide22_0010-0020.wav|That is the name of our program Artificial Intelligence What do you think about artificial intelligence? Question 1 about artificial intelligence
slide_slide22_0020-0030.wav|As like human intelligence is limited by things Professor, okay, good. What about other source? What do you think about
slide_slide22_0030-0040.wav|Artificial intelligence. Okay. Good. What about other thoughts? What do you think about artificial intelligence? Yes, exactly.
slide_slide22_0040-0050.wav|What about the other source? This is so yeah. It's still kinda often. What about the other source of of from online students?
slide_slide22_0050-0060.wav|Your mind, what do you think about artificial intelligence? And did you notice some difference between AI and machine learning? Which one is bigger?
slide_slide22_0060-0070.wav|Yeah. Student five? If, variety is machine learning some of the way in implementing AI and
slide_slide22_0070-0080.wav|Since this, AI is a set of methods that can use methods can study by itself to resolve some problems. Professor, yes.
slide_slide22_0080-0090.wav|Exactly. You got it. In the next few slides, we are the first using AI and then we are talking about the machine learning.
slide_slide22_0090-0100.wav|So we will talk about AI a little bit for other differences between AI and the machine learning has already noticed in in this
slide_slide22_0100-0101.wav|Right?
slide_slide23_0000-0010.wav|But first of all, for the AI, what is AI? So actually, in one sentence, they are more like AI is the science of
slide_slide23_0010-0020.wav|Making intelligence machines which can perform tasks that require intelligence when performed by humans and therefore,
slide_slide23_0020-0028.wav|Important components, that is, the perception, the learning, the abstraction and reasoning.
slide_slide24_0000-0010.wav|So first of all, was the perception of we also say it as, representation so in AI, perception
slide_slide24_0010-0020.wav|As a process to interpret, acquire, select, and then organize the sensory information from the physical world to make sense.
slide_slide24_0020-0021.wav|As like humans.
slide_slide25_0000-0010.wav|But what about learning? So the learning is the ability of a system to improve its behavior based on experience. So
slide_slide25_0010-0014.wav|Most likely, it's behavior based on appearance. Right?
slide_slide26_0000-0010.wav|But the reasoning reasoning is a way to infer facts from existing data it is a general process of thinking rationally
slide_slide26_0010-0020.wav|To find valid conclusions, what are the differences between machine learning and machine reasoning? Right? So what is
slide_slide26_0020-0030.wav|About finding patterns machine learning has always tried to try to find some logic between those patterns and why the other one is
slide_slide26_0030-0040.wav|About understanding relationship. It's more like a human being with seeing a deep understanding what was the relationship
slide_slide26_0040-0047.wav|Between them, like tackling new problems with a deductive and inductive reasoning approach.
slide_slide27_0000-0010.wav|Professor, what about abstraction? So abstraction is a fundamental mechanism underlying both human and artificial
slide_slide27_0010-0020.wav|Perception, representation of knowledge, reasoning and learning it aims to take a knowledge that is discovered at the
slide_slide27_0020-0030.wav|Level and applying it at other level, so then another question, so among those four different aspects, Which
slide_slide27_0030-0040.wav|One, but you are assuming as mostly important or mostly difficult for AI on our desk. So perception
slide_slide27_0040-0050.wav|Learning, abstract, abstraction, or reasoning. Which one? Like, which one? What was the challenge? How about you
slide_slide27_0050-0060.wav|Question one, abstraction. Professor, why abstraction? Professor, yes, you are saying that his gift code established?
slide_slide27_0060-0070.wav|But yeah, yeah, that's that's a problem, right? Student two, reasoning. Professor, okay, what about
slide_slide27_0070-0080.wav|To others. Do you agree with her or you have a different opinion? Okay. So now, let's direct you to
slide_slide27_0080-0082.wav|Answer.
slide_slide28_0000-0010.wav|So what about the bottleneck of the AI? So actually it's just about abstraction and reasoning, the key reasoning is about for the
slide_slide28_0010-0020.wav|AI is still very difficult for them to make sense of the theory behind all those objects, especially about reasoning and really about understanding.
slide_slide28_0020-0030.wav|The mechanism behind this problem. Sometimes it is very difficult for, like, human beings, right, especially about detective and
slide_slide28_0030-0038.wav|If you want machine learning to do some tasks that have never turned before, it is very challenging for them.
slide_slide29_0000-0010.wav|And here in a big picture of the AI system architecture, it's more about end to end of the headline.
slide_slide29_0010-0020.wav|There are lots of applications, there there's lots of arguments there. So probably, I would like to understand from those.
slide_slide29_0020-0030.wav|Robust AI is the AI only here just mentioned like of five different aspects like the
slide_slide29_0030-0040.wav|Verification and validation is more like you like your phone.
slide_slide29_0040-0050.wav|You use a phase to unlock it, right? And the security team, the other one is about the policy, ethics, and
slide_slide29_0050-0060.wav|Safety, training problem, and also there are lots of models, modern, like, computing device as you
slide_slide29_0060-0070.wav|See, you definitely guys can see CPUs. Right? And then you know about GPUs. I've been watching that. You already here.
slide_slide29_0070-0080.wav|About that, and you'll probably notice that the GPU, which is more robust work than CPU and you have this custom and
slide_slide29_0080-0090.wav|Quantum computing and other stuff, right? But before, again, those cannot use in machine learning models like that data is
slide_slide29_0090-0100.wav|Always our first task right? Altogether and data here is about data collection, data management, like
slide_slide29_0100-0110.wav|Especially the amount that data labeling is a big challenge for all existing machine learning. For those, you definitely need to provide feed
slide_slide29_0110-0120.wav|Bank about a dataset. So in the initial stage, it's, requirement for humans to provide something. So that is about
slide_slide29_0120-0130.wav|These are about reason why the labeling is now still very challenging. Also, we have so many different implementing models or
slide_slide29_0130-0140.wav|Models but data labeling is also a very different difficult process and after that we have some algorithms, yeah, just
slide_slide29_0140-0150.wav|Several different types like unsupervised learning, supervised learning, we also have reinforcement learning, etcetera, yeah.
slide_slide29_0150-0160.wav|Other side side, we have like human and the computer interaction so that we can get better performance. So for human and the
slide_slide29_0160-0170.wav|Interaction, the HCI and Israeli would like a little bit longer time than single computer models, but you know
slide_slide29_0170-0180.wav|It will get much higher accuracy, so love it. This area is also very popular. And also, we have several other applications.
slide_slide29_0180-0188.wav|So let's mention first of those applications any questions? No? Okay, great.
slide_slide30_0000-0010.wav|Professor, now let's talk about what is different between AI and the machine learning. So you already noticed that machine learning is just a branch
slide_slide30_0010-0020.wav|Of AI, but what are the details of them? So for the AI in that scientific field concerned with the development of algorithms that
slide_slide30_0020-0030.wav|Allow computers to learn without being actually programmed, but for the machine learning, it's just a branch of it which focuses on
slide_slide30_0030-0040.wav|Methods that learn from data and make predictions on unseen data and them for the machine learning, we really care about prediction channel and
slide_slide30_0040-0050.wav|Different kinds of predictions, right? So here is the general process of machine learning, so during the training stage, we have
slide_slide30_0050-0060.wav|Labeled dataset. What about labeled dataset student one? Labels are input data professor, what do we mean by them?
slide_slide30_0060-0070.wav|Label the input data. So then one features and labels, professor, feature and labels cn, that's yes. Exactly.
slide_slide30_0070-0080.wav|I agreed with that. What about other labels in the dataset? Oh, you you question that? What is the label of the dataset?
slide_slide30_0080-0090.wav|Data um. Okay. Great. Yeah. Go ahead. Student two, unlabeled data. Professor yeah um, the labeled data, what is labeled data?
slide_slide30_0090-0100.wav|Student tuning. I think we have some datasets, for example, we have several samples and each sample has has some labels,
slide_slide30_0100-0110.wav|That is it defines some class, for example, professor, yes, good, I see you guys
slide_slide30_0110-0120.wav|Shade yet, right? So the label of the dataset definitely will provide some labels for the datasets. For example, like images q and
slide_slide30_0120-0130.wav|Image of a cat. The label is a cat. You have labeled it, so it is a labeled dataset. Right? So for example
slide_slide30_0130-0140.wav|You've got some stock price predictions, so the stock price on your level our levels of it, right, giving you
slide_slide30_0140-0150.wav|Your your time series data and the year, another stage of of machine learning is called prediction or called the test stage. We
slide_slide30_0150-0160.wav|Have another kind of labeled datasets, but we will use this this time, and we will try to use trained machine learning models based on training stage. We
slide_slide30_0160-0170.wav|And check to make some predictions for the test dataset set and then even we want to evaluate the performance,
slide_slide30_0170-0180.wav|Of the machine learning models. Right? Any questions? Okay. Student one. Is the reinforcement learning in this category professor?
slide_slide30_0180-0190.wav|I do not have yet yet that yet in few slides but reinforcement learning is different from those so here we
slide_slide30_0190-0194.wav|We'll see it. Okay. That's a good question.
slide_slide32_0000-0010.wav|So definitely, you know, we will go back to a long time ago. Right? It's like seventy years ago or so.
slide_slide32_0010-0020.wav|Ago, but that is in the nineteen fifties. The first light of machine learning is very related to the trick player. So
slide_slide32_0020-0030.wav|Of that in the nineteen sixties, like the earliest offer network, it's called perception as it was born at that time.
slide_slide32_0030-0040.wav|However, after that, it was proved that perception is not working, so then we were able to expand more reasons about their product.
slide_slide32_0040-0046.wav|In the nineteen seventees, we also have other common algorithms.
slide_slide33_0000-0010.wav|So then let's go back to nineteen eighties, so we have advanced decision tree and the rolling learning of the previous
slide_slide33_0010-0020.wav|Yes. Later in the nineteen nineties, so in this case, we will have more a back view of machine learning like that, there is a mark.
slide_slide33_0020-0028.wav|Finding some tasks and learning, some reinforcement learning and inductive logic programming, etcetera.
slide_slide34_0000-0010.wav|Even recently like in two thousand, this is like a majority of traditional machine learning algorithms that are already
slide_slide34_0010-0020.wav|Invented at that time, for example, the support vector machine, the kernel methods, the graphic method, the statistical reason
slide_slide34_0020-0030.wav|Rational relearning from transfer learning, etcetera. And then it includes, so you like, knowledge
slide_slide34_0030-0040.wav|About two years ago in the two thousand tens. In that, stage, and like, deep learning is rarely and becomes popular. Right?
slide_slide34_0040-0050.wav|So out of that, in the next decade, like, two thousand and ten, the deep learning is most likely everyday work
slide_slide34_0050-0055.wav|so um, is going to increase that economy.
slide_slide35_0000-0010.wav|Next, I would like to introduce them, what is machine learning and why should we study how we care about
slide_slide35_0010-0011.wav|She's learning. Right?
slide_slide36_0000-0010.wav|Have you ever thought how easily we can recognize face, the color, the shape of handwritten characters?
slide_slide36_0010-0020.wav|How will the children learn to balance or develop preference onto some tests? Right? I don't know whether you guys have some time to
slide_slide36_0020-0030.wav|About that or even like humans' cognitive abilities have transformed every aspect of our lives and the world.
slide_slide36_0030-0039.wav|The human mind is a set of cognitive, gadgets and, supposed to learn.
slide_slide37_0000-0010.wav|So this is about the intuition of showing how it handles themselves. Actually, there are no specific features that
slide_slide37_0010-0020.wav|Identification giving and zip, just giving from the experience, like an infant, like a poor baby.
slide_slide37_0020-0030.wav|Who will be content just the first time of ignorance. Right? Which your per parents post them like?
slide_slide37_0030-0040.wav|We probably noticed that our eyes can take an image like every two hundred milliseconds and we have
slide_slide37_0040-0050.wav|Like, five pictures per second, and the total around three pictures per minute as there are lots of amount of data.
slide_slide37_0050-0060.wav|That given as input. But does that mean where they are increasing our age? Definitely, they see more and the more image.
slide_slide37_0060-0070.wav|Yes. Right? What about the world? And that's about our children, so really humanness learn from experience.
slide_slide37_0070-0080.wav|Once or sometimes if you make a mistake in the that first case, you will probably in the next time you
slide_slide37_0080-0090.wav|You try to avoid it, right, if you even in the second time, you may make a mistake again, but there is no so many times you definitely you can recognize.
slide_slide37_0090-0094.wav|and definitely you can avoide providing some mistakes.
slide_slide38_0000-0010.wav|And then another good question about how machine learning is different from traditional programming. Here's an example here. If I
slide_slide38_0010-0020.wav|Ask you how to write a program like a pseudo code to identify a gate. To identify a case in an image. How would you do it?
slide_slide38_0020-0030.wav|Any ideas? So you don't know when you mentioned I'm not very good to do, and I'm here no ideas by the
slide_slide38_0030-0040.wav|Model is bigger, professor. Yes. That's very good spectrum. What about some thoughts about you guys use tradition?
slide_slide38_0040-0050.wav|Programming how to identify this cat and its source it comes without a result still without a solution
slide_slide38_0050-0060.wav|We really talk about some in the early stage without computer vision problems, but what the kind of
slide_slide38_0060-0070.wav|The easiest solution that you can think of is to how distinguish whether that is a kid or not. Now what about
slide_slide38_0070-0080.wav|Online student, do you guys have any thoughts? How can you write a program about identifying whether this is a cat? See you.
slide_slide38_0080-0090.wav|To for example, if for example, if some type like triangle and for each for each part of the body
slide_slide38_0090-0100.wav|Like, for example, for eyes, eyes like green or blank and for and for each for each type of body to
slide_slide38_0100-0110.wav|Sum of if a statement and a check if that's related to a cat or not, professor. Good. You have a similar
slide_slide38_0110-0120.wav|Solution to your classmates so let's see student 3 can I say something? Professor, professor, do you have another?
slide_slide38_0120-0130.wav|The solution, student three, so first, we convert this RGB image to black and white image and then make a decision
slide_slide38_0130-0140.wav|We can make a classifier like logistic logistic stick regression, a classifier on a gradient boosting classifier, which classify
slide_slide38_0140-0150.wav|The image professor Ye. So actually your answer is similar to Juju. You did use that. This is more like
slide_slide38_0150-0153.wav|Is some kind of advanced solution.
slide_slide39_0000-0010.wav|So let's give us the variant, you know, early stage whether we can do for that. And some of you you are noticed that
slide_slide39_0010-0020.wav|So we have a branch of if else statements. If you like some quote, follow them through fast.
slide_slide39_0020-0030.wav|The key thing is, we want to detect some small parts of, kind of images. Right? For example, we want to detect the color
slide_slide39_0030-0040.wav|We want to detect the shape, we want to detect the length, and we have so many different if else statements. So finally to decide
slide_slide39_0040-0050.wav|Whether that is correct, but one question is, is that enough? How many those standard if if else statements do need to
slide_slide39_0050-0060.wav|Make how many? You don't know right. Even them better, right, because there are so many parts of the
slide_slide39_0060-0070.wav|Image, right? And this is big, so that is very about some traditional programming because traditional programming is we are
slide_slide39_0070-0080.wav|Not, care about the image. The computers classify itself, right, only care about some small stuff, How to make them?
slide_slide39_0080-0090.wav|Together, but in this case, the machine learning is more like the thing of our whole image, not just, for example or small parts.
slide_slide40_0000-0010.wav|For example, can we manually write an algorithm or hard code that caters all the variance like traditional
slide_slide40_0010-0019.wav|Can they do that? Probably very challenging, right, because different poses of cats. Right?
slide_slide41_0000-0010.wav|Very challenging. I mean, different shape. Strange shape somehow has a cat more like water. It can be in any shape. Right?
slide_slide41_0010-0017.wav|So that means that you need to test your very challenge with that environment.
slide_slide42_0000-0010.wav|So then for the machine learning algorithms, an algorithm that will then follow from data of our experience and then
slide_slide42_0010-0020.wav|There is no need to formulate expected rules in the algorithm, performance gets better with experience or data if
slide_slide42_0020-0030.wav|You have more and more data, definitely, your machine learning algorithm can output a good accuracy, but we are hearing about that.
slide_slide42_0030-0040.wav|Even sometimes, you know, you cannot get more data, but, you can do some data augmentation. Try to generate some some big data that you have
slide_slide42_0040-0049.wav|So also try to get some better results. Then models will be allowed to get an application plan.
slide_slide43_0000-0010.wav|So now we talk about the questions some what is machine learning? And this is very important The early stage of computer
slide_slide43_0010-0020.wav|In nineteen fifty nine, so the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.
slide_slide44_0000-0010.wav|And this guy says that machine learning is the study of computer algorithms that allow computer programs to automatically improve through
slide_slide44_0010-0020.wav|Experience. And then in this case, we often care about automatically. Right? That is important because we won't save our time.
slide_slide44_0020-0030.wav|Because we are human beings. Right? And we are we were lazy. We don't we cannot do everything. We want some computers
slide_slide44_0030-0031.wav|to do that.
slide_slide45_0000-0010.wav|And the machine learning algorithms ingest data and models like more like the hypothesis, so the learned model
slide_slide45_0010-0020.wav|Be used to detect sub patterns, detect sub trends, detect structures, etc. From datasets and then we make predictions on unseen data.
slide_slide45_0020-0028.wav|Or the new data set. And later we will talk about those annoying applications.
slide_slide46_0000-0010.wav|The next question is, why study machine learning? Why is it important? Here's the case in that we want to develop a better computer system.
slide_slide46_0010-0020.wav|To help us. So to develop computer systems that are too that is difficult and inexpensive to construct them manually because
slide_slide46_0020-0030.wav|They require a specific detailed skills or knowledge tuned to a specific task. As usual, the knowledge engineering bot
slide_slide46_0030-0040.wav|If you have your own dataset, dataset especially in industry, every company even has their own dataset. Right?
slide_slide46_0040-0050.wav|In that case, you need to build your own model. Again, create some labels, retrain these situations that you cannot prevent. So
slide_slide46_0050-0060.wav|This is called the bottleneck. Why do we have that? To develop systems that can automatically adapt and customize themselves to
slide_slide46_0060-0070.wav|Users. For example, personalized news, the mailing filtering, for example, sometimes you have some app.
slide_slide46_0070-0080.wav|And give you some exceeding news that you are about that. Right? But I keep giving you some coming out in this field.
slide_slide46_0080-0090.wav|And also in your mail, so every day, you get lots of spam email. Right? So you can also detect that nothing is about
slide_slide46_0090-0100.wav|Personalized tutoring. We also can discover new knowledge from large database. This is really about the data mining part. For example,
slide_slide46_0100-0110.wav|About the market basket analysis and about the medical tax mining to gather some most common past incubators
slide_slide46_0110-0120.wav|Whether you have some diseases, some kind of information, some drugs you take. Right? So that can give you personal recommendation for that.
slide_slide47_0000-0010.wav|So why machine learning is necessary? So learning is a hallmark of intelligence. So how would argue that a system that can
slide_slide47_0010-0020.wav|Learn is not intelligent. So, actually, without learning, everything is new. Right? A system that cannot learn is not efficient because it
slide_slide47_0020-0030.wav|Reloads each solution and repeatedly makes the same mistakes. So why is, learning possible? Because
slide_slide47_0030-0037.wav|Regularities in the world, you can find some common patterns between a lot of them, we have a data problem, right?
slide_slide48_0000-0010.wav|You will try to use machine learning For example, in the speech recognition for example, you will use Siri and ask her to do
slide_slide48_0010-0017.wav|Something for you, right, to customers. Do you find something for you like that in the speech recognition?
slide_slide49_0000-0010.wav|And also, in the video recognition with machine learning to try to recognize whether this is a dog or whether that is
slide_slide49_0010-0011.wav|A cat. Okay?
slide_slide50_0000-0010.wav|And also about the face detection to recognize weather in the face. Again, those kinds of bounding box. Right? And also above
slide_slide50_0010-0017.wav|Expression recognition of whether you are happy or whether you are sad. Right? We have some different things.
slide_slide51_0000-0010.wav|And, also, we can recognize, handwritten digits. For example, this kind of very weird. Right? It's it is weird. Right?
slide_slide52_0000-0010.wav|And also some models are customized, As I've said before, for example, the personalized medicine, the personalized
slide_slide52_0010-0020.wav|Recommendation like a home assistant, they are uniquely, and we are uniquely. Everybody is a unique person. Right? We have lots
slide_slide52_0020-0030.wav|Human races. Right? So that in the future, the personalized stuff will be very important for all of us. Models are based on a huge amount of
slide_slide52_0030-0038.wav|Says that you guys already mentioned that. For example, line genomics, like a stock price prediction.
slide_slide53_0000-0010.wav|And, also, like, CF driving cars care about autonomous driving. Right? So this is all about some bigger debts.
slide_slide54_0000-0010.wav|And even we can use machine learning to help us exploring something that not exist. For example, the navigation task because our human has
slide_slide54_0010-0017.wav|Been there before, right? Who can use some robot machine help us be explored first, right?
slide_slide55_0000-0010.wav|You care about the human capacity to be argument, maybe use machine learning tools, this is whether all this part
slide_slide55_0010-0020.wav|Is really not a corpuscle sum. Remember, my previous slide is this part is really about corpuscle sum, this part and this part. So
slide_slide55_0020-0030.wav|Part is actually related to memory. Now that you will have some kind of increase, so in parts of it, let's say, in the
slide_slide55_0030-0037.wav|We will find those parts if they shrink. You might have some problems with that. Okay?
slide_slide56_0000-0010.wav|Another trend is about why machine learning models are so popular. Right? Because, there are so many places that we needed to use machine learning
slide_slide56_0010-0020.wav|Example is the medical images that I mentioned before in the speech recognition and even in the robotics and that especially in that computer
slide_slide56_0020-0030.wav|Field like the person personal identification, the activity recognitions, some object detection, and the autonomous driving, and then
slide_slide56_0030-0040.wav|Also, there's another key reason that we wanna use machine learning as we want to include some existing machine learning models. Right? And also
slide_slide56_0040-0050.wav|Yeah. Ability of large volumes of datasets, and we want to make sense of our data. So nowadays, it's very easy to get
slide_slide56_0050-0060.wav|Lot of datasets. Right? That's a lot of images from your phone. But do you want to segment your images on your phone? Do you want to do that?
slide_slide56_0060-0070.wav|Then you find an object in your phone images, no one wants to do that. It's not necessary. Right? So in your dataset, if you
slide_slide56_0070-0080.wav|Can can do label it. There is no sense in this data. And, also, the CRM custom customized the software, for example.
slide_slide56_0090-0097.wav|To use machine learning, and this is the key reason why machine learning nowadays is so popular and important.
slide_slide57_0000-0010.wav|And, also, there are lots of related displays. For example, it is directly related to the AI. I think you guys, We
slide_slide57_0010-0020.wav|Another class for the artificial intelligence. Probably, I will teach it next semester. It depends on whether it is we have a lot we have
slide_slide57_0020-0030.wav|Professors have become my colleagues, but anyway, you guys need to take this class And probably in the future, you need to take another class called
slide_slide57_0030-0040.wav|Enforcement learning that is close to this artificial intelligence, another displaying called the debt mining, and all of you guys are familiar with that.
slide_slide57_0040-0050.wav|About the probability and the statistics, information theory and the numerical optimization, the computational complexity theory and the control
slide_slide57_0050-0060.wav|Psychology, neurobiology, linguistics and the philosophy, all those different displays that remember Need a submachine.
slide_slide57_0060-0062.wav|Learning algorithms to help us
slide_slide58_0000-0010.wav|So now I want to talk about the tocsotomy of machine learning. We typically have around this kind of four different aspects.
slide_slide58_0010-0020.wav|Like, the supervised learning, the supervised learning, the semi supervised learning, and the reinforcement learning, another category of machine learning. For the
slide_slide58_0020-0030.wav|Learning we have we will use labeled dataset, right, as the unsupervised learning just to discover patterns in unlabeled dataset.
slide_slide58_0030-0040.wav|No labels for dataset. And for the semi supervised learning, you will get a turn trend of small portion of your labels for dataset.
slide_slide58_0040-0050.wav|But for the reinforcement learning, we will not talk about labels or no labels, but we, we will care about how did you
slide_slide58_0050-0060.wav|Act based on the feedback or calls, cool cards, reward from your environment, like, for example
slide_slide58_0060-0063.wav|the play go here.
slide_slide59_0000-0010.wav|Is this slide is more about it's just classified into three. And in the previous slide, we
slide_slide59_0010-0020.wav|Had a semi supervised. Another count between those ones, As a majority, we have three those three different categories, for example, is
slide_slide59_0020-0030.wav|Supervised learning, we will have our typical knowing tasks like classification, regression and a ranking problem.
slide_slide59_0030-0040.wav|The unsupervised learning, we will have, like, the clustering, the dimensionality reduction, and the unsupervised by
slide_slide59_0040-0050.wav|Intensity estimation, and there's a lastly about reinforcement learning. So after reinforcement learning, firstly, it doesn't use a label
slide_slide59_0050-0060.wav|Unlabeled data is a traditional sense is a reinforcement learning. An agent learns via its interactions with any environment.
slide_slide59_0060-0070.wav|So called feedback of driven policy learning. So we will care about its feedback from the interactions between your
slide_slide59_0070-0080.wav|Environment. And then they are also let me come out with other messages that I needed to mention. Let's say them
slide_slide59_0080-0090.wav|Supervised learning that we we already mentioned, and we have active learning. We have transport learning. We have the multitask learning.
slide_slide59_0090-0100.wav|Will have, like, limitation learning. So here, I kind of relate to reinforcement learning, and we have few
slide_slide59_0100-0110.wav|Learning in nowadays, and I don't know whether some of you have heard us that about that or not. And even we have the zero shot
slide_slide59_0110-0120.wav|Learning in machine learning. We probably have no labels or data sets, but we still can predict them, so called the zero short learning. This is
slide_slide59_0120-0130.wav|Fancy learning algorithms, by the way, we are not covered in this class. You probably will see it in your future classes.
slide_slide60_0000-0010.wav|So next thing is about the details of supervised learning. For example, we have numerical classifier functions like linear
slide_slide60_0010-0020.wav|The perception, especially about logistic regression. I think all of you should know about from your first semester. Right?
slide_slide60_0020-0030.wav|About this logistic regression, about the support vector machine, SVM, and also about the neural networks. So all of those
slide_slide60_0030-0040.wav|Numeric classifier functions, and you will have some parameters functions, parametric, or probabilistic.
slide_slide60_0040-0050.wav|Specifically, as they are related to some probability can function like naive, ban based, and discriminator.
slide_slide60_0050-0060.wav|Gaussian Discriminate Analysis, the GDA, the the hidden, microphone models.
slide_slide60_0060-0070.wav|The probabilistic graphic models, and we have non parametric models, so this is related to some instance based functions for
slide_slide60_0070-0080.wav|The non parametric models they just they need just that those models vary depending on dataset they don't care
slide_slide60_0080-0090.wav|Some kind of parameters. For example, the k n the k nearest neighbor, it cares about as nearby instance. Right?
slide_slide60_0090-0100.wav|Kernel regression and also similar to kernel density estimation, some local regression, and we have we have the Symbolicity
slide_slide60_0100-0110.wav|Functions like the decision trees, the classification, the regression trees, right, decision trees form as I can apply for this pyramid period.
slide_slide60_0110-0120.wav|To the task list, and we have the ensemble learning, like the begging, the boasting, as the boasting room, and the random forest.
slide_slide60_0120-0128.wav|For majority of those kinds of methods, we will cover the rest of the semester, you will see about that.
slide_slide61_0000-0010.wav|What about another category is unsupervised learning, like categories and techniques? For example, clustering. The key means clustering. The mid shift
slide_slide61_0010-0020.wav|The spectral clustering, the density estimation function like GMM, the Gaussian Mixture Model, the Graphic Model, and the
slide_slide61_0020-0030.wav|Dimensionality. The dimensionality reduction mentioned, like the PCA, like factor analysis, and so on. All of those are some
slide_slide61_0030-0031.wav|Why is the learning?
slide_slide62_0000-0010.wav|Professor, now let's try to talk up some framework of existing supervised learning and unsupervised learning.
slide_slide62_0010-0020.wav|About reinforcement learning, right? So given a bunch of images of training datasets labeled dataset let's find those images like in the box
slide_slide62_0020-0030.wav|The cat. After we used some kind of feature extraction and when and with its labels, we will try to train some machine
slide_slide62_0030-0040.wav|Algorithms after that, we can try a a good, predictor to detect whether it's a cat or
slide_slide62_0040-0050.wav|Weather is dark. Right? So then keeping at any test image, also, after feature extraction, we can get some
slide_slide62_0050-0060.wav|Predictor labels. Right? However, why important the process is called feature extraction? Well done.
slide_slide62_0060-0070.wav|That mean? And here what is the feature extraction? Student one taking specific call quality of the the that content, but we are
slide_slide62_0070-0080.wav|In those labels. Professor. Yes. Any other source about the feature extraction? Student two. We have some data.
slide_slide62_0080-0090.wav|We have some information, but we are using some methods. We can get some more information from the data and some
slide_slide62_0090-0100.wav|Information, professor, yes, it can be yes, exactly. Specifically more about the feature extraction is like some kernel
slide_slide62_0100-0110.wav|Method to extract some key features from data So here, it is the images. The key feature
slide_slide62_0110-0120.wav|From images, for example, those cats if you want to extract some corners, some con contour information, some border boundary information
slide_slide62_0120-0130.wav|So those are so called super power features that can extract. But in our machine learning class, we will not talk about how to
slide_slide62_0130-0140.wav|Extra features. But in your another different, learning class, we will talk about how to extract those deep features or the traditional features.
slide_slide62_0140-0150.wav|I think maybe all of you guys should have take that deep learning class. Right? I guess you've already registered. Right?
slide_slide62_0150-0160.wav|You already did that. Yeah. Last semester. Yeah. But, again, for the feature extraction, you guys will learn in tomorrow's class. Okay. So later
slide_slide62_0160-0163.wav|You will get more sense of it.
slide_slide63_0000-0010.wav|Another task about the unsupervised learning. One row for a classroom for example in this case you have no labels above the images.
slide_slide63_0010-0020.wav|But here, previously you had all sorts of those cats. So this is called labels, right? In this case, you
slide_slide63_0020-0030.wav|Have no labels. You just have images. Right? After you do a feature extraction and, I can gather this kind of one dimensional vector.
slide_slide63_0030-0040.wav|For each image, and also you try to train some machine learning algorithm, you have, like, those different clusters. So this is really
slide_slide63_0040-0050.wav|Based on some clustering method. Right? For example, that like some knn k nearest neighbor, you will probably choose.
slide_slide63_0050-0060.wav|The given the k is equal to one, you will definitely choose the most of closed samples as in the same categories.
slide_slide63_0060-0070.wav|For example, if those two cats are very close to each other, you say, You are thinking as you should, be in one category. Right?
slide_slide63_0070-0080.wav|And then you can put it here, but if you find this cat and this dog, they are different from each other, like distance
slide_slide63_0080-0090.wav|Between those three images is big. So definitely, you needed a spot into two different classes. Right? So eventually, you Can't get
slide_slide63_0090-0097.wav|Those two different classes, this is, cool called unsupervised learning.
slide_slide64_0000-0010.wav|Lastly, I want to brief mention about reinforcement learning. So actually, this is about the overall framework of reinforcement learning. As you can see
slide_slide64_0010-0020.wav|You will probably have the your environment state. You have several states for that. State s, if you try try move
slide_slide64_0020-0030.wav|So which state? And for example, you will play this little game, you have some kind of observations whether you can jump, Was it u
slide_slide64_0030-0040.wav|Feed something, whether you can eat something right, and you will get some reward. So rewarding typically about your scope.
slide_slide64_0040-0050.wav|Score. So if you can jump some obstacles, you will get a higher score. Right? So that is the so called reward in this case.
slide_slide64_0050-0060.wav|The action action doing, in this case, is maybe just about just about to move forward, Move bank or jump.
slide_slide64_0060-0070.wav|Right? This is part of that for different actions that you can perform in this task. And out there, you have some agent state. So
slide_slide64_0070-0080.wav|After you perform a kind of action, you will jump to another state. For example, if you take action for work, you can move to that for work.
slide_slide64_0080-0090.wav|Step. Right? You'll make some reward. You will get some scores or you will lost the scores. So that is probably reward here. But
slide_slide64_0090-0100.wav|Anyway, you guys will learn more details that in the AI, artificial intelligence class, or reinforcement learning class, and specifically for
slide_slide64_0100-0110.wav|Student who says that he's interested in game gaming. This is very important for you. Those two classes, the ARM and this reinforcement
slide_slide64_0110-0120.wav|Learning. But sometimes usually for this AI or reinforcement learning. For the homework, you guys have some kind of gap to replace some gap.
slide_slide64_0120-0122.wav|Whether you can win or not.
slide_slide65_0000-0010.wav|And, also, this is about the traditional flow work of classification, and this is exactly what we needed to learn in this class. So in this class, we
slide_slide65_0010-0020.wav|We only utilize a kind of traditional machine learning models. For example, I like the decision tree, the SVM, the KAN, The MLP
slide_slide65_0020-0030.wav|And there's a naive base. So those all of those traditional methods, and that it is the problem. Some
slide_slide65_0030-0040.wav|Called the feature extractions that I've mentioned before. For example, you will try to extract them SIFT features, the Hawk features,
slide_slide65_0040-0049.wav|The SURF features. So in tomorrow's class, we will more care about the feature extraction model.
slide_slide66_0000-0010.wav|And, here's about lots of machine learning algorithms. For example, by the numerical functions, we have linear regression, Numeric Neural
slide_slide66_0010-0020.wav|Works support vector machine and the symbolic functions, we have decision trees, processional logic, rules for the first
slide_slide66_0020-0030.wav|All the predictive logic, and we have for the instant based functions. We have k nearest neighbor, and we have the case based
slide_slide66_0030-0040.wav|And we have for the probabilistic graphic models, we will talk about naive Bayesian networks, the Are they
slide_slide66_0040-0050.wav|Even about the Microsoft network, so this is about awesome kind of machine learning algorithms. But again, due to the limited time
slide_slide66_0050-0060.wav|The fourth semester, we won't be able to cover all that algorithms, but I will emphasize some very significant ones and some
slide_slide66_0060-0064.wav|Someone I will ask you to do for your future interview those algorithms.
slide_slide68_0000-0010.wav|For example, this is very about the medical diseases diagnosis is left for about this image. Any idea about this image?
slide_slide68_0010-0020.wav|Yes. Actually, an x-ray of your lung units. Right? So in this case, you can diagnose whether you have COVID or not.
slide_slide68_0020-0029.wav|So there are already a lot of publications that talk about whether diagnose whether you have or not from your x-ray images.
slide_slide69_0000-0010.wav|And we also have this, personal identification. So given your face images, while I try to detect whether you
slide_slide69_0010-0020.wav|Your eyes, where is your nose? Where is your mouse? Right? It's funny areas. Right? It's really about personal identification. So
slide_slide69_0020-0027.wav|For your iPhone, then very well, we will use those kind of important points to unlock it.
slide_slide70_0000-0010.wav|And then lastly, it is about biometric, about using the fingerprint. So, actually, before we use that kind of sequence
slide_slide70_0010-0020.wav|To unlock home using your finger. Right? In the early world, the windows like two thousand six and something like that.
slide_slide70_0020-0027.wav|And then I worked. You will use your fingerprint to unlock your home. Right?
slide_slide71_0000-0010.wav|And even we can try to analyze your posture. I mean, this kind. In the left hand, it's about the human, and in the right hand
slide_slide71_0010-0012.wav|just tries to shoot a posture.
slide_slide72_0000-0010.wav|And we also have another semantic recommendation about lab ads, just the images on the right hand, just a cover.
slide_slide72_0010-0019.wav|Of some labels of those different objects like the cars, the roads, the trees. Right? All different kinds of labels. Yes?
slide_slide73_0000-0010.wav|Also, there's another one about the medical image documentation. So the left one just is one MRI image. So
slide_slide73_0010-0020.wav|Hand we try to segment this white matter of perimeter of it, that is, blue color. The center has the yellow
slide_slide73_0020-0022.wav|And there's a red color here.
slide_slide74_0000-0010.wav|Now also for this care about the stock. So this is about the stock price prediction. A little bit. Right? I can use
slide_slide74_0010-0012.wav|She'll learning to do that.
slide_slide76_0000-0010.wav|So there are lots of different robotics using the machine learning tool. For example, there are several areas that we can use.
slide_slide76_0010-0020.wav|Robotics, like industrial robot, the military, the governments, and the space exploration robots, service robots
slide_slide76_0020-0030.wav|From home, the health care, electric, so why are the robots used? Because some tasks, it is very dangerous for human.
slide_slide76_0030-0040.wav|Right? And there's that's there's some repetitive tasks for some tasks that you will repeatedly do it so
slide_slide76_0040-0050.wav|Is not able to do it. And another way is, by high precision tasks. All those who require high quality like to make
slide_slide76_0050-0060.wav|Some GPUs, definitely, you need a machine instead of human. Is that right? And even to save your time and
slide_slide76_0060-0068.wav|Control technologies. For example, autonomous driving also like another thing about a remote control. Right?
slide_slide77_0000-0010.wav|So here's about the several frequently used robotics in the industry likes painting, the cutting, some assembling, Some
slide_slide77_0010-0020.wav|Material handling, some like packaging, machine loading, all kinds of different robotics. They have some machine learning algorithm inside for
slide_slide77_0020-0028.wav|Example, like packaging, the first need is to recollect objects. So then you can package those objects.
slide_slide78_0000-0010.wav|And this is the users for robotics in an inventory of manufacturing like the automotive and also
slide_slide78_0010-0012.wav|About is this, packaging stuff.
slide_slide80_0000-0010.wav|And, also, there are other kinds of military or government robots as iRobot Pack Robot a kind of bot.
slide_slide80_0010-0016.wav|And the remote remote address above those different machines.
slide_slide81_0000-0010.wav|And even about the soldiers in a kind of world as they try to use some robot and do that. And even now is
slide_slide81_0010-0020.wav|Famous. So a kind of them that are still that are working in Ukraine, probably, you heard about that. They use jaws like
slide_slide81_0020-0022.wav|Can now trend to do that. Right?
slide_slide82_0000-0010.wav|A soldier robot throws some bombs to human beam, so this is like, I'd like to say, in UAV, the area we draw.
slide_slide82_0010-0018.wav|And also about military suits, or about this case try to do some detections, some problem of it.
slide_slide84_0000-0010.wav|And also, there are lots of other service robot, you may have it at home or in the office by cleaning and, host
slide_slide84_0010-0020.wav|By others. So many inspections and blah blah as they assume can some kind of robotics you might have already
slide_slide84_0020-0030.wav|That. However, for each robot, there are lots of machine learning algorithms. I kind of like for this kind of clean robot and has
slide_slide84_0030-0040.wav|To prevent how to decide what is distance between different objects. Right? Definitely, you want to avoid some objects at home.
slide_slide84_0040-0050.wav|You do not want to break it, either to break, the object or to break the robot itself. What about this cleaner?
slide_slide84_0050-0058.wav|The algorithm in this area is just very similar, it just only needed to get a sense of of distance, right?
slide_slide85_0000-0010.wav|And then, many medical and healthcare applications. So nowadays, there is more and more applications that have been heavily applied.
slide_slide85_0010-0020.wav|In the medical field, like you see, once you tried with a hospital, it was a lot of machines which catch it with you. Right?
slide_slide85_0020-0027.wav|Here's about your heart rate or some kind of measurement. All the all of them are machines. Right?
slide_slide86_0000-0010.wav|And, also, we have some laboratory applications like the drag discovery, a test tube sorting all. So all about
slide_slide86_0010-0013.wav|Can be some useful to us in a laboratory.
slide_slide87_0000-0010.wav|And this is a famous sentence from Birgitte that a breakthrough in machine learning will be worth 10 Microsofts. Is that
slide_slide87_0010-0012.wav|two, I think. Right?
slide_slide88_0000-0010.wav|I guess this manning is the most content that we have today. So next, probably, I will, talk about some kind of potential work you guys can
slide_slide88_0010-0017.wav|Do when you try to finish this course, typical straight kind of open job.
slide_slide89_0000-0010.wav|And you you definitely have more chance to get those three parts I list For example, the artificial intelligence engineering, some machine learning engineer
slide_slide89_0010-0020.wav|Some data analysis, all those kinds of jobs that you guys can try to apply. But, again, you know, first of all, in the interview, You guys
slide_slide89_0020-0030.wav|Definitely need to learn about some coding stuff. That's all about basic about machine learning questions. Right? What is supervised learning? What is
slide_slide89_0030-0040.wav|Unsupervised learning. That's a very easy question. They will ask you how do you provide an overfitting, how do you implement the can can and stuff like that.
slide_slide89_0040-0050.wav|For example, you guys have such a lot of those questions, like machine learning, and then that's the key reason you guys need to start in this.
slide_slide89_0050-0059.wav|Course carefully because it it will directly affect your future. Hopefully, you guys can learn a lot from this class. What is next?
slide_slide90_0000-0010.wav|Next, actually, I have the first homework for you guys. The first homework is very easy. Right? It is just about ask about the thinking part. What is
slide_slide90_0010-0020.wav|Machine learning. And what is the future of machine learning? Easy. Right? Remember, use your own sentence. Okay? Because I have another task for you guys that
slide_slide90_0020-0030.wav|You guys probably heard about chat gbt. Right? That's perfect. Right? Or you guys heard about that. You guys need to try to use the Chat GPT.
slide_slide90_0030-0040.wav|And, you have already tried that. You tried that? What about you guys don't? So now you guys have a chance officially
slide_slide90_0040-0050.wav|Remind this class, I will require you guys also to provide some answers from chat gbt answers. Okay? So, basically, which means that
slide_slide90_0050-0060.wav|We upload the 2 files. two text files include our question and your answer. For example, your question, just what is machine?
slide_slide90_0060-0070.wav|Learning and what is the feature of machine learning. But for the change gbt, you also modify those questions a little bit because it can give you some different
slide_slide90_0070-0080.wav|Answers, you just you definitely want to get a different answers from your classmates. Right? But the case about your own answer
slide_slide90_0080-0090.wav|Remember to write your own sentences because in this time, I will check. It's use online, a grant a kind of detection tool if you have
slide_slide90_0090-0100.wav|Some come some sentences copy from online. You will probably have some trouble with that. I think you guys have already
slide_slide90_0100-0110.wav|About academic integrity during the orientation. Right? So that is very important. I do not want to say the details of
slide_slide90_0110-0120.wav|It. But again, try to remember it. Do not copy it from online. Do not copy it from your classmates. Okay? It's okay. It's easy. Yes?
slide_slide90_0120-0125.wav|Yes. Exactly. You needed to upload the two text files. Right?
slide_slide91_0000-0010.wav|So for example, here is the example from me from me. And since this is for the examples from the chat gpt, but the question, what is
slide_slide91_0010-0020.wav|Machine learning and how machine learning can change in the future. And this is the solution that, it gives to me. So it says machine learning is blah blah blah
slide_slide91_0020-0030.wav|Learning has the potential to change the future in a number of ways. Some of you might get exactly the same answer, but that's fine. I don't want you guys modify the
slide_slide91_0030-0040.wav|So from the check gbt, in this case, the case I want to do that, the one thing that is, I want to ensure you guys not to
slide_slide91_0040-0050.wav|From online, especially now if JetGPD is very famous, very popular, that already some professor noticed that some student use their
slide_slide91_0050-0060.wav|This right at the homework, then submit it. So now I directly want you guys to do that. So that I can
slide_slide91_0060-0070.wav|Very verify whether it is you or you got a machine. You definitely finally, you after you finish this class, you will not say
slide_slide91_0070-0080.wav|Well, you cannot beat a machine. Right? You cannot beat the a chat gbt with a good answer. Right? Try to avoid that. Okay. Others probably
slide_slide91_0080-0089.wav|That's about my last slide. I hope you guys have can any question re regarding the to any questions. Okay? Okay?
slide_slide92_0000-0010.wav|Any more questions? What about our online students? Any questions about you guys? Any questions? No? Okay. What about the homework?
slide_slide92_0010-0020.wav|Otherwise, clear out. Okay. That's good. If not, so then our class is finished today, and you guys have a good night and
slide_slide92_0020-0027.wav|Now I hope I will see more of you next week. Okay? Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, sir.
slide_slide1_0000_0000.wav|As you guys have probably already noticed that I'm currently an assistant professor at our AI program.
slide_slide21_0000_0000.wav|So now let's talk about passed out today, that is introduction of Machine Learning.
slide_slide31_0000_0000.wav|So next, I want to briefly mention about the history of the Machine Learning.
slide_slide67_0000_0000.wav|So then, we will move to the application field.
slide_slide75_0000_0000.wav|And also, there are lots of revolution in the robotics nowadays. Right?
slide_slide79_0000_0000.wav|So, here's just about some automotive kind of machine here.
slide_slide83_0000_0000.wav|And also, you know about the space robot that I mentioned before to try to explore the Mars. Right?
