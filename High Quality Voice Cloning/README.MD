This work presents two different approaches to text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis. We incorporate speaker variance information beyond duration (pitch, energy) to enrich the modelâ€™s understanding of speech variations. These features are used during training and inference, improving the one-to-many mapping problem in TTS. The second approach focuses on high-fidelity audio generation with long-term coherence.
